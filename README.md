### Welcome
In 2023, I made the decision to switch my personal website from Wordpress to Gatsby after using Wordpress for five years. This was my first project of the year, as I wanted to learn React.js to pursue my dream of becoming a software developer. The transition was quite challenging for me since I had only worked with Visual Basic .NET previously to create desktop applications for tasks such as point-of-sale, stock management, sales reports, and other similar functions.

I would say that this project was not built completely from scratch since it bears a resemblance to the original website. However, it was a small but significant step for me in learning about React.js.

Finally, I hope to maintain my motivation and continue working hard in pursuing my dream of becoming a software developer.

### Inspiration
This project is inspired by [Tania Rascia's](https://github.com/taniarascia/taniarascia.com) blog theme which thankfully she make it Open-Source.

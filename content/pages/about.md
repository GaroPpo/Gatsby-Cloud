Greetings! My name is Eric Liputra, a dedicated and enthusiastic professional driven by a passion for overcoming challenges and continuous learning. My journey in the ever-evolving realm of information technology started during my high school years, where I discovered a profound curiosity for coding and web development. Despite limited resources, I embarked on a self-taught journey, mastering skills ranging from basic Blogspot customization to crafting intricate WordPress themes. As a team player, I thrive in collaborative environments while also possessing the independence to tackle tasks autonomously.

### My Story

I was born in Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia, in June 1995.

My journey into the world of technology began during my high school years when I taught myself HTML and CSS through blogging. In 2011, I created my first blog, igniting my passion for web development. Since then, I've honed my skills, mastering various aspects of website creation and design.

**In 2014**, I embarked on my first professional career journey as a Content Writer and Social Media Admin at TEAMnxl>, Indonesia's leading eSports team by that time. This role immersed me in the exciting world of eSports, particularly Counter-Strike: Global Offensive tournaments, fueling my passion for competitive gaming.

**In 2016**, I bravely ventured into freelance software development, specializing in crafting desktop-based point-of-sale applications using VB.Net, Crystal Report, and Dev Express. This journey not only broadened my programming expertise but also honed my communication skills and problem-solving capabilities. Drawing from my experience, I aimed to offer the best advice as a person with an IT background, striving to create applications that provide users with convenience in carrying out operations through intuitive and efficient features.

**In 2017**, I embarked on significant transitions in my career journey. I made the decision to resign from TEAMnxl>, where I had served as a Content Writer and Social Media Admin for the leading eSports team in Indonesia. Additionally, I proudly graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, solidifying my dedication to the technology field. Despite briefly exploring roles outside the IT industry, such as working as an Accounting Staff at a Local Wholesale Company (**yes, you read it right!**), my passion for coding remained unwavering. Even in non-technical positions, I continued to sharpen my programming skills, laying the foundation for my eventual return to the tech industry.

During the transformative period from **2020 to 2022**, I experienced a series of significant shifts in my career journey. Firstly, I bravely resigned from my accounting staff position, signaling a deliberate pivot in my professional path. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, I remained resilient and adaptable, navigating through uncertain times with determination. In a bold entrepreneurial move, I co-founded a screen printing business with a close friend, embracing creativity and commerce amidst adversity. Simultaneously, I took on the role of Store Manager at a friend's cafe shop, applying my managerial skills to contribute to its growth and success. These experiences have been instrumental in shaping me into a more versatile and adaptable professional, equipping me with the skills and resilience needed to navigate the dynamic landscape of the business world with humility and readiness to embrace new challenges.

**In 2023**, I found myself juggling two exciting and demanding roles that kept me on my toes!

Firstly, I took on the challenge of becoming a Freelance Operational Manager at Rise Up Basketball Academy. In this role, I was responsible for managing finances, ensuring smooth day-to-day operations, and maintaining positive communication with parents regarding practice schedules and fees. It was a role that demanded both organization and empathy, but the opportunity to contribute to the development of young athletes was incredibly rewarding.

At the same time, I seized my very first professional position in the IT industry as an IT Specialist at Stella Maris Makassar Hospital. This marked a significant milestone in my career journey since graduating in 2017. In this role, I played a vital role in maintaining and optimizing the hospital's technological infrastructure. From developing customized software solutions to providing comprehensive IT support and enhancing network security, I embraced the challenges of the healthcare sector with enthusiasm and dedication.

Balancing these dual roles was no easy feat, but it was undeniably fulfilling to make meaningful contributions to both the sports and healthcare industries. Each day presented new opportunities for growth and learning, reinforcing my commitment to excellence in every endeavor.

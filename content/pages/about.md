### My Story

I was born in Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. In June 1995.

I taught myself about HTML and CSS from blogging. It was when I created my first blog on second-grade senior high school back in 2011. At that time, I learned how to make or add a feature to my blog, also edit the design or change the color of my blog. Since then, I have a passion for Web Development, where I can make my own website.

In April 2014, I started my professional career as a Content Writer and Social Media Admin at TEAMnxl>, which is the most successful eSports team in Indonesia at the time. Since then, I have a passion for eSports that make me enjoy watching eSports Tournaments, especially Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

In July 2017, I was graduated from college with a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science. After graduation, I work as an Accounting Staff at a Local Wholesale Company. Yes! You have not read it wrong. I was strayed far from my background as an IT person. Although working outside the IT field, it doesn’t stop me from coding.

In late 2020, I resign from my position as an Accounting Staff and decide to pursue my passion for Programming, especially in Web Development.

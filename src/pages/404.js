            Today, we know that the ocean makes up about 71% of the Earth' surface, and it is the biggest ecosystem of the planet, holding 99% of all habitable space in the world. As much as we try to picture its vastness, however, it remains almost incomprehensible.

            It might be shocking to find out, but <b>ONLY 5%</b> of the ocean has been <b>explored</b> and charted by humans. The rest, especially its depths, are still unknown.
